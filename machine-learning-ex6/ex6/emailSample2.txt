Good Morning Byron,

 

I hope you will take the time to complete a survey to help improve the STEM center and Foundations Lab.  Whether or not you have used the STEM Center or Foundations Lab...we want your opinion!

 

From the surveys we receive by SUNDAY July 29th, we may choose some students to join a focus group for a one-hour discussion.  There is a place on the survey to tell us if you are interested in participating.  Students chosen for this group will receive lunch and a $20 gift card. 

 

Going through the survey and checking the boxes that match your opinion should take less than ten minutes, and that's fine.  If you also leave comments that will help even more. 

 

To start the survey, please click the link below, or copy it into your address bar.

Thank you,

 

Eric Reed

STEM Center Director
